# Goal

to provide examples of best practices for a standard react application

## TODO

implement development / production build optimizations
add support for typescript, scss modules
implement react router
implement jest
implement MiniCssExtractPlugin

- css caching across page loads
- immediately applies styles (reduces screen flicker)
- faster page loading, faster rebuilds (live style update)
